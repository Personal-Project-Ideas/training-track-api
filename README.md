## ðŸ›  Development Setup

### Prerequisites

ðŸ›  Git Hooks setup using pre-commit
  
  1. Install pre-commit:  
  If you donâ€™t have pre-commit installed yet, you can install it via brew (macOS) or pip (Python):
  
  ```bash
    brew install pre-commit
  ```
  or
  ```bash
    pip install pre-commit
  ```

  2. Install the hooks with:

  ```bash
    pre-commit install
    pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
  ``` 

This will configure the hooks to run automatically before each commit.
